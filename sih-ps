By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. Expected Solutions: 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it’s services based on these insights.
