## SIH1615: Learning Path Dashboard for Enhancing Skills

### Background
Instructors often have educational resources in various formats such as PDFs, Word documents, and hyperlinks to relevant academic literature. To facilitate a more effective learning experience, there is a need for a system that can consolidate these resources and track the progress of learners. While a simplified solution could take a consolidated .bibtex file as input, the ideal approach would involve using an Excel sheet for better organization and management of resources.

### Detailed Description
The proposed solution should allow instructors to create comprehensive learning paths that incorporate a variety of educational resources, including videos and documents in different formats. The system should be capable of tracking various reading statistics, such as the time spent on a particular topic and the total time required to complete a specific skill. As learners progress through the learning path, their progress should be continuously updated and reflected on the dashboard.

### Expected Solution
The desired learning path dashboard is expected to:

1. Display reading statistics, such as reading time for specific topics and total time required to complete a particular skill.
2. Enable instructors to easily create and manage learning paths, integrating various learning resources, including videos and documents.
3. Continuously update and reflect the learner's progress in real-time.
4. Follow UX principles to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

### Key Features
